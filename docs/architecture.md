# Architecture

## Overview

A2ASecBench separates attack data, SUT interfaces, orchestration, harness services, scoring, and validation. The main entrypoint is `orchestration.py`: it loads a config, imports case classes, loads the requested SUT, runs trials, writes JSONL records, and creates a summary file.

## Attacks

All benchmark cases inherit from `AttackCase` in `attacks/base.py`.

- `ASCase` presents multiple AgentCards and expects a selector to choose the benign card.
- `CCCase` presents an AgentCard plus either backend source code or a localhost A2A endpoint.
- `A2ASecurityCase` provides structured-oracle calibration probes for ASRF, ATSI, CO, and HOTF.
- `A2AExecutableCase` starts an official `a2a-sdk` in-process peer environment and scores real environment events.
- `CardDiffCase` starts a local A2A HTTP+JSON server and scores AgentCard control-plane trace events.

## System Under Test (SUT)

SUTs are loaded by dynamic import paths in config files:

```yaml
sut:
  selector: "sut.as.heuristic_selector:HeuristicSelector"
  kwargs: {}
```

Main interfaces:

- `SelectorSUT.select(task_prompt, cards)` for AS.
- `ComparatorSUT.compare_whitebox(card, backend_code)` for CC whitebox.
- `ComparatorSUT.compare_blackbox(card, backend_endpoint)` for CC blackbox.
- `A2ASecuritySUT.run_probe(case, env=None)` for protocol-level A2A attacks.

Raw chat-completion LLMs are suitable for AS and CC SUTs. Executable A2A attacks require an action-capable coordinator wrapper that calls harness APIs such as `fetch_resource`, `render_artifact`, `delegate_task`, or `create_task`.

CardDiff runs use `sut.a2a.carddiff_host:CardDiffHostSUT`, a single local
Host SUT that fetches public and extended AgentCards, selects an A2A
HTTP+JSON interface, sends `message:send`, and records artifact acceptance.
The revised benchmark method places an LLM-assisted scenario adapter before the
AgentCard perturbation layer so that natural-language task diversity is primary
and protocol-state perturbations are optional oracle-preserving variants.

## Harness Services

Executable A2A cases use official SDK protocol peers plus local harness components:

- `OfficialA2APeer`: exposes each scripted peer through SDK AgentCard discovery and JSON-RPC `message/send`.
- `LocalHTTPTrapServer`: records local resource dereferences and artifact callbacks.
- `ArtifactRenderer`: records artifact rendering and triggers local callbacks only when active content is rendered.
- `DelegationTracker`: records delegation edges, closed paths, and depth-limit evidence.
- `TaskStore`: records retained half-open tasks and task-store pressure.
- `A2AEnvironmentClient`: exposes controlled actions to executable SUTs.

Harness services are local-only and scoped to one trial. They create protocol events such as `a2a_agent_card_fetched` and `a2a_message_sent`, plus scoring evidence events such as `uri_dereference`, `artifact_executed`, `cycle_detected`, `max_depth_exceeded`, and `task_store_pressure`.
