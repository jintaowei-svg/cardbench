# A2ASecBench Documentation

A2ASecBench is a Python benchmark harness for evaluating security behavior in agent-to-agent systems. It provides decoupled benchmark cases, pluggable Systems Under Test (SUTs), deterministic offline baselines, optional LLM-backed SUTs, and executable local environments for coordinator-level attacks.
